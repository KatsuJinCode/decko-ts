The comparator accepts `--additional-contracts <file>` for candidate-only
post-capture product checks. It reports this policy's SHA256 separately in
`integrity.additionalPolicy`; the captured default-policy hash is still checked
on both original evidence sets. Additional status/text/type requirements cannot
override default requirements or actual executed-step expectations. Unknown
journeys, observation labels and unsupported expectation keys fail closed.
These checks evaluate recorded observations; they do not claim that new browser
assertions ran in the reference capture. Original files are never rewritten.
