# Row mx-190 - the search whole count: the port-side instrument re-verified green at the tranche-3 base

Row: `mx-190-search-whole-count-correctness` in the completeness roster
(`brandonDojoTech/docs/registry/completeness-roster.json`, family
matrix-journey, bucket WORKING ON IT). Instrument-coverage-matrix action 189
(ACT-190), kind findings-red. Finding F-2026-10-16-search-over-match.

This is tranche 3 of the family (branch
`port/matrix-journey-tranche-20261020`, this row verified at commit
`9a3899b1`, the tip that carries the mx-155 follow-view work). The ask for
the non-gap rows: verify the port side with a named runnable check and fix
genuine defects.

## The named runnable check, run at this base

The row's own port-side instrument is the search-overmatch module of the
signed-in exercise (the check tranche 1 ran as "grind tranche-1: --only
search-overmatch at d8050251, PASS 7/7"). Run fresh at this base:

    node tools/edge-signed-in-exercise.mjs --only search-overmatch \
      --deck C:/localProjects/decko-ts-turn-on-editing/tmp/brandon-local-edit/deck.sqlite3 \
      --out .runtime/matrix-journey-tranche3-20261021/overmatch-run/report.md

Result: **7 / 7 checks passed** (run record:
`.runtime/matrix-journey-tranche3-20261021/overmatch-run/report.md`). The
four legs the row's blocker names all pass at this base:

- the fixtures store two public term cards, a control and an
  administrator-only card behind a self read rule;
- the term's search hands the administrator-only row to the administrator
  and withholds it from an ordinary member (the viewer-scope leg);
- every returned row carries the term in its own name or its own stored
  content (the accounting leg);
- the module records a deck-wide broad-term composition measurement.

The cleanup legs pass (the owned local stack closed; every journey-created
card removed from the local copy), and the final browser asset audit passes.

## The deck fingerprint is unchanged

The tranche-2 measurement binds the port's whole count (317 rows over 16
pages for `query[keyword]=news`) to the deck sha256
`6aebb6546a0620f3c61efad28cd01023e104d47ffd583272ce18036038f73b78`
(`docs/reports/row-mx-190-search-whole-count-port-side-measured-2026-10-21.md`).
Re-measured at this base:

    sha256sum C:/localProjects/decko-ts-turn-on-editing/tmp/brandon-local-edit/deck.sqlite3
    -> 6aebb6546a0620f3c61efad28cd01023e104d47ffd583272ce18036038f73b78

The same hash. The tranche-2 receipt's port count and its re-scope carry
over unchanged; this tranche re-runs the instrument, not the page walk.

## The row's state after this verification

- No genuine defect surfaced: the instrument's four legs are green at the
  new base, and the port-side work this row carries (the overmatch
  instrument) needs no change.
- The finding F-2026-10-16-search-over-match STAYS OPEN and the row stays
  WORKING ON IT, for the measured cause tranche 2 recorded: the oracle's
  whole count cannot be taken on this machine's rungs (Decko's `match`
  raises on the sqlite adapter, card-1.110.0
  config/initializers/02_patches/active_record.rb:80-83; the MySQL rung's
  three machine-local assets are absent). The named next step is unchanged
  and is not this lane's: provision the MySQL-rung assets on the machine
  that runs the oracle, boot the same deck fingerprint there, record the
  oracle's whole count beside the port's in one receipt.
- Nothing here deploys and nothing touches live.
