# Edge signed-in exercise, round nine: the C6 row at this round's tip

The branch is `port/capability-round9-20261024`, created from
`port/capability-round8-20261024` at `c265530a`, the newest pushed
capability tip. The run below ran at this round's tip on its own checkout.

One run, on the LOCAL stack that the harness boots itself: the loopback
database and object storage, a local copy of the deck on the engine schema,
two throwaway local accounts (one holding the `administrator` role, one signed
in with no role), headless Chromium with a throwaway profile. Nothing reached
the live edge and nothing was written to the live D1: the run's provenance
carries `productionRuntime: false`. The source deck is the same local
snapshot the earlier rounds used, SHA-256 `6aebb6546a0620f3c61efad28cd01023e104d47ffd583272ce18036038f73b78`, and the executed
bundle is the deploy's own artifact, SHA-256 `f00a1ca66b91871e8f0445e3a76abb8806bf5c9d36876bf1ecc6900003e3afe7`.

## The grade line

**293 / 293 checks passed**, 0 failed, 0 skipped.
No check failed in this run.

## The C6 row (search for a nonexistent name offers a create link)

```
node tools/edge-signed-in-exercise.mjs --out .runtime/edge-signed-in/round9-family/report.md
```

| check | result | the evidence |
|---|---|---|
| search for a nonexistent name offers a create link | PASS | the typeahead offered the missing name as its own add item, carrying the searched term as its value and the card's own path as its destination |
| search for a nonexistent name offers a result-specific create link | PASS | the destination answered 200 with the create form for that name, and the offer's label matched the committed Ruby capture byte for byte |

WHAT THIS ROW DOES NOT CLAIM: the search RESULT page's own echo, its
empty-results marker and its row list are the N6 row's contract and are not
claimed here; nothing about a name that EXISTS is claimed here; and the create
form the destination serves is graded only as the form for that name, not as
the whole new-card surface.

## The battery

The row's parity pins ran with `node --test` over the row's own pin
files at this tip: `tools/edge-signed-in-exercise/test/search-create-offer.test.mjs`
and `duplicate-name-error.test.mjs` (C6, C8), `tinymce-nest-plugin.test.mjs`
(E3), `engage-tab.test.mjs` (E20), `history-pills.test.mjs` (E21),
`rename-referers.test.mjs` (R1), `rule-set-legs.test.mjs`,
`p5-fixture.test.mjs`, `p5-visited-card-and-own-slot.test.mjs` (P5) and
`rule-permission-set.test.mjs`, `p6-board-path.test.mjs`,
`p6-seed-rule.test.mjs` (P6) pass, 0 fail. The whole round's pin battery is
stated on the family receipt.
