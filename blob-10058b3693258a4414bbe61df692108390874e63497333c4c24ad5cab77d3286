// Pin the byte-level / parity contract for the permfix2 fixes:
//
//   (1) HELP-RULES LATE VERDICT PASS — render.ts:305-323 re-calls
//       ensureVerdicts after helpResolver.prepare() so the *help rule cards
//       enriched late (help-popover.ts:439-444 cacheFetchedRecord loop)
//       land in this.deniedVerdicts. Before the fix, isDenied returned
//       false for those rule cards (the verdict cache missed) and the
//       sync render path emitted placeholder body paragraphs instead of
//       Ruby's `<span class="denied">`.
//
//   (2) SEARCH/DATE BROADENED PREPARE WALK — render.ts:1239-1319
//       prepareSearches walks the closure from root via {{name}} content
//       references, then iterates renderCards.values() once for any
//       SEARCH_TYPE_CODE / DATE_TYPE_CODE cards that did not join the
//       BFS queue. Ruby's card-mod-search cql_search.rb raises
//       Card::Error::BadQuery on invalid-JSON content for ANY reachable
//       Search card — Search cards with garbage content were unraised
//       before the broaden because the BFS did not reach them. The second
//       pass invokes runSearch (BadQuery) and isValidDateContent
//       (dateError) for every Search/Date card in renderCards — Ruby
//       semantics mirror: ok_to_read? — denial short-circuits the
//       closed Search card, but for the readable branch the JSON.parse
//       raise is unavoidable (cql_search.rb:29-38).
//
//   (3) DENIED-SEARCH VERDICT ISSUANCE — a Search card whose stored read
//       rule is unreadable still gets its denial verdict issued during a
//       closed-view render, and searchResults stays empty for the deny
//       branch: Ruby's altered_view denial wraps the view BEFORE
//       view_method dispatches (view/permission.rb:46-50), so the search
//       never runs at all. (The closureWarm Search gate itself is not
//       pinned here — it is unchanged.)
//
// Each "it" block below exercises one of these three seams at the
// fixture scale, mirroring the deck shapes, so a future revert fails
// here first.
