// Pin the anonymous actorId threading: the
// engine's permission state must carry the signed-out viewer's OWN card id
// as a party — Ruby's parties are all_enabled_roles + [self]
// (card-mod-account set/abstract/account_holder.rb:27-29) and
// fetch_read_rules unions the cache over [AnyoneID] + parties (:115-123) —
// so Anonymous resolves parties [AnyoneID, AnonymousID], never [AnyoneID]
// alone. The engine parsed its state from this.viewer verbatim
// (ANONYMOUS_VIEWER, no actorId) and dropped the [AnonymousID] party;
// ensureReadPermission now resolves it from the batch's codename rows
// (the resolveAnonymousReadPermission pattern, src/card/permissions/
// read-rules.ts:352-360).
//
// Neutral on the shipped deck's stored rules (measured: 0 read rules grant
// the anonymous party alone, 0 grant anonymous-but-not-anyone), but the
// parties
// must match Ruby's for any deck whose rules grant [[Anonymous]].
