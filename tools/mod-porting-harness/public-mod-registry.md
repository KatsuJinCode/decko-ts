# Public mod registry — the porting-harness progress tracker

Generated 2026-10-14T11:17:29.249Z by tools/mod-porting-harness/mod-harness.mjs registry

Every public mod is ported and behavior-validated. Private mods are the only exclusion (none in the installed gem set — every row's public evidence names its gem).

**35 ported / 0 unported / 0 private-unknown** across 35 mods.

**Honest gap note:** the mod-level ported status does not mask behavior gaps — 6 ported mod(s) still carry 23 missing view(s) per the re-measurement (card-mod-account: 6, card-mod-follow: 4, card-mod-format: 2, card-mod-history: 1, card-mod-style: 4, card-mod-tinymce_editor: 6). Those behaviors are unported INSIDE ported mods; their rows show them in the re-measure column until their harness scorecards land.

**Harness coverage of the registry:** 10 of 35 rows carry a harness scorecard; the other 25 are cited on compat-report evidence only and are the next surface/capture/verify runs to make.

Re-measurement cite: view census at tree 0287dab: 377 declared views / 174 byte-pinned / 354 render-at-all / 23 missing; 28 of 34 mods with zero missing views.

## Private-unknown evidence policy

A mod is marked `private-unknown` only with evidence that its source is site-private (not published). The installed `card-mod-*` gem set is public by construction (published gems with LICENSE files), so no row carries private-unknown here. The TS-only marketplace row cites its no-gem status.
