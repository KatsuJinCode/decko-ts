# oracle-capture-edit-forms.rb - oracle capture for the card-mod-edit CORE
# EDIT-FORM PATH (write-path slice 3): the signed-in edit view for a standard
# card — the modal wrap, the frame/help slots, the card_form update form
# (name editor, type row, content input, conflict tracker hidden field,
# save/cancel/delete buttons) — plus the anonymous denial behavior.
#
# Run (from tools/oracle/decko-oracle-app):
#   RAILS_ENV=development bundle exec decko runner \
#     <repo>/tests/card/mod-loader/oracle-capture-edit-forms.rb
#
# Records to <script-repo>/fixtures/captured/edit-forms.json:
# 1. For each target card (an existing basic RichText content card and the
#    deck-level Home card) and each actor (Decko Bot = signed-in admin,
#    Sara = signed-in non-admin member, Anonymous): the rendered :edit view
#    bytes (modal-wrapped frame + form) and the inner :edit_form bytes.
#    Anonymous renders raise Card::Error::PermissionDenied - recorded as
#    {denied: true, class:, message:} (what Ruby gives anonymous at the
#    view level; the controller turns the same error into the denial page).
# 2. The edit-conflict validation state: a stale last_action_id_before_edit
#    + update! on the basic card - the detect_conflict validation event
#    (card-mod-history set/all/history/events.rb:19) adds the :conflict
#    error and aborts; the rescue records the error class/message. NO row is
#    written (validation failure = no act); the script asserts the
#    card_actions count is unchanged and records that proof.
#
# Targets are EXISTING cards ("Oracle Basics" id 605, "Home" id 521 - both
# seeded by the oracle smoke seed). The capture performs ZERO card writes:
# no Card.create/update on any target; the only update! is the conflict
# probe whose validation failure prevents persistence (proven by the
# action-count assertion below).
#
# Determinism contract (mirrors oracle-capture-content-inputs.rb): output
# JSON is pretty-printed with deeply sorted keys + a trailing newline;
# random/dynamic attributes are normalized to placeholders:
#   data-slot-id  (random hex per slot - Ruby assigns fresh ids every render)
#   data-card-id  (row ids are seed-state, not form semantics)
#   data-select2-id ("<unique_id>-<epoch seconds>" - Time.now based)
# The TS test applies the same normalization to its own renders before
# comparing. A re-run must produce byte-identical JSON (verified: the two
# runs recorded in tmp/wrong-goal-hunt/forms-lane.md).
