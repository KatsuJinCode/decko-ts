// Depth-3+ junction inclusion closure: the defect-2 regression tests.
//
// DEFECT (docs/deploy-notes.md finding 2): the prefetcher could not resolve
// junction (NULL-key) nest targets deeper than two parts. The original walk
// matched frontier keys against cards.key - which junction rows do not
// carry - and the JS fallback's side-key join required BOTH sides of a
// junction reference to be simple keys, so "A+B+C" (left side "A+B" is
// itself compound) never resolved and the render threw
// "nest target not found: A+B+C" where Ruby rendered.
//
// FIX (src/card/render/prefetch.ts): the closure rounds resolve compound
// references recursively through their sides - simple sides by the indexed
// key column, compound sides by the UNIQUE left_id/right_id pair join once
// the sides' rows are cached - so junction targets resolve at ANY depth.
// (The 2026-09-23 read-cost fix replaced the whole-deck `resolved` CTE with
// these rounds; the mechanism under test is the same side-recursion.)
//
// NAMING in these fixtures: parts use digit-suffixed names (chain_c1,
// chain_c2, ...) because DeckoName.key SINGULARIZES (measured: key of
// "beta" is "betum"), so alphabetic stems make the span-extracted
// reference key diverge from the composed key - the plural-stem miss the
// last test below covers deliberately.
