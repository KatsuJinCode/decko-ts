// Pin the byte-level contract of the render-perf prewarm fix (benchmarks/
// corpus-v2/prewarm-static-deck.ts:162-236): the prewarm must discover
// every Search-type card in the seeded deck by the SAME codename the engine
// gates on (card.typeCode === "search_type", the codename the type card's
// codehash carries — src/card/render.ts:1189 sets card.typeCode =
// peekNameForId(typeId) + render.ts:1258 + render.ts:1131). The original
// discovery gate read the type card's NAME ("Search") instead of its
// codename ("search_type"); corpus search-type cards carry a random-named
// type card (deck:30 codename=search_type, name=qnzkqz) so the old
// discovery skipped every card → searches=0 → closureWarm returned false
// for every search-type rule card after prewarm → warm-render-sample
// averaged 127-150ms (with a ~750ms cold-closure spike cluster, the 9
// "*right+*structure" rule cards in the first 60) and closureWarm-coverage
// was 47 cold cards.
//
// The fix: prewarm gates on codename, not name. Since the R4 lazy-parse
// seam (render.ts prepareSearches) a search card whose cql parse fails is
// recorded IN THE ENGINE (searchFailures marker + empty seat) and the walk
// completes — the raise moved to the dispatch boundary (engine.resolveView,
// view-gated on :open/:content per the capture census), so the prewarm's
// catch arm no longer feeds the render path at all. The pins below lock
// both halves: the seat coverage (closureWarm budget-0) and the boundary
// raise/NoRaise per view.
