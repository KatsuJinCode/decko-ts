// The _left read-rule delegation is ONE mechanism with TWO entry paths, and
// this file pins both on the same deck so they cannot drift apart:
//
// 1. THE LOOKUP PATH (write/derivation time — set-read-rule.ts): when a
//    read_rule_id is DERIVED for a card (the set_read_rule store event,
//    deriveReadRuleRecord -> permissionRuleId -> leftPermissionRuleId,
//    permissions.rb:52-72), a compound card whose winning read rule's
//    content is the `_left` reference stores its LEFT card's effective rule
//    id. The stored id bakes the left chain in; the read verdict for that
//    row then needs no walk (canReadByStoredRule).
//
// 2. THE LIVE-WALK PATH (read time — read-rules.ts canReadByRuleLookup):
//    a card without a stored read_rule_id (new card, fetch placeholder, row
//    predating the column) resolves its rule at verdict time, and the same
//    `_left` content check (LEFT_DELEGATION_CONTENT) routes the verdict
//    through readThroughLeftCard — the left chain walked with delegation
//    re-checked at every hop (Ruby re-runs permission_rule_id per hop).
//
// Both paths must resolve the SAME left-chain rule for the same card shape:
// the derived stored id and the live walk's winning rule id agree, and the
// verdicts agree (allowed when the left reads, denied when the left locks).
